# Steel Tools & Armor Fabric 1.21.1 Mod

Im Converting this mod idea to NeoForge due to increased growing support and simplicity
Also if you want to use the Fabric version thats no longer supported feel free, no license will apply to it! the Neoforge one will however, i might develop different versions in the future but now at most i can only develop a single one.


This is my first minecraft and mod in general ive ever developed its mostly just so i can see what i can make but also i think the implementation of this mod is also extremely cool 
it will remain public if theres any issues or anything else with the mod of if someone wants to contribute

I do plan on continually updating this mod but early on in its development it will be very interesting due to me being new to the textures/models for minecraft aswell as using the fabric libraries

### About the mod (features are still being added)
This is a armor/tool mod that adds Steel into the game as a between point of Diamond and Netherite armor
It adds slight complexity to producing steel ingots
First you smelt an Iron Ingot in a blast furnace to then turn it into Molten Iron
after you recieve the molten iron you combine the molten iron and compacted coal (from the mod) into steel
to progress to netherite you NEED steel armor so instead of upgrading from diamond to netherite its steel to netherite!
unless you just dont care for netherite

Netherite will also recieve buffs due to this new Resource being added and itll will be more complex to make netherite armor
